All modified Bigworld shaders and new shaders should be placed here. This is to differentiate from the BigWorld original shaders (which should remain pristine in "bigworld/res/shaders").

If your shader tweaks aren't appearing, be sure to delete all the .fxo files in the "bigworld/res/shaders" directory.

If there are Bigworld updates to the original shaders, and you would like to integrate those changes, use a diff tool to merge differences.
